1) The 5" display is crap (doesn't do pinch gestures, hard to read).
   TODO: instead of a "tablet" style based on platform (e.g. arm7)
   the screen size should (also) be used.

2) When the device / computer has not changed timezone, the clock and
   tide times show in the old timezone. I will try and modify the 
   mkgeonames scripts to include the timezone in the geonames "database"
   and adjust based on the current location.
